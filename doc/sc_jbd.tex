	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The problem of symbolic regression (SR)~\cite{billard2002symbolic} is one of a central problem in Machine learning, has attracted many researchers to study it over the last decade. the problem itself can be seen as a generalization of specific variants of regression where the functional form is pre-assumed in advance, e.g., the well-known linear regression, polynomial regression~\cite{stimson1978interpreting}, etc. 

\fxnote{TODO}

%All regression models have the same goal: given a set of $n$-dimensional input data and its corresponding continuous output target variable, the aim is to find a  mathematical expression (function) of $n$ (input) variables that best \emph{fits} the target variable.  %This computationally intensive task is in general provenly NP--hard~\cite{virgolin2022symbolic}. 
%In the case of linear regression, the model is always a linear combination of input variables. This is in general not good enough, since the target variable might be dependent on a nonlinear function among input variables. Unlike linear regression, SR allows for the search over much larger space of possible mathematical formulas to find the best-fitting ones, i.e., those able to predict the target variable from input variables. The basis of constructing an explicit formula is in elementary operations like addition and multiplication, as well as polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and other operations.

\section{Problem definition} \label{sec:search-space}
XX
\fxnote{TODO}
%In this section we formally define the SR problem.

%\begin{definition}
%	Given is a dataset $D = \{(\mathbf{x_i}, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\mathbf{x_i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents the i-th feature (input) vector while $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is its corresponding target (output) variable. Suppose that there exists an analytical model of the form $f(\mathbf{x})= g^*(\mathbf{x}, \theta^*) + \epsilon $ that is a generator of all observations from $D$.  
%	The goal of SR is to learn the mapping $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{x})=  \tilde{g}(\mathbf{x}, \tilde{\theta})  \colon \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  estimated by searching through the space of (mathematical) expressions  $\tilde{g}$ and parameters $\tilde{\theta}$ where  $\epsilon$ is the observed white noise within the given input data. 
	
%\end{definition}

%Koza~\cite{koza1994genetic} introduced the problem of SR as a specific application of genetic programming. GP can be used to optimize nonlinear structures such as computer programs. In particular, programs are represented by syntax trees consisting of functions/operations over input features and constants. As an example of a function represented by a syntax tree, see Figure~\ref{fig:syntax-tree-example}. In essence, all valid syntax trees form the solution search space of SR. That is, each sample model $\tilde{f}$ may be seen as a point in the search space, represented by a respective syntax tree. The solution accuracy can be computed on the basis of historical data $D$ and the chosen error measure such as $MSE$, $RMSE$, $R^2$, their combination, etc. Interestingly, the nature of SR search space is twofold: discrete and continuous. It is primarily modeled as a problem of discrete (combinatorial) optimization, since the number of possible solution functional forms is countable. However, it may also include elements solved by means of continuous (global) optimization, e.g., constants (coefficients) fitting. It is common to use the set of the following elementary mathematical functions: $\sqrt{x}, x^2 $, $\sin$, $\cos$, $\log$, $\exp$, $\arcsin$, $\arccos$, $a^x$, and a set of standard arithmetic operators: $+$, $-$, $\cdot$, and $/$.
